                    <span>Walt Disney’s Early Life</span>
                    <p>Walter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois. Raised on a farm in Marceline, Missouri, young Walt developed a love for drawing, often sketching animals and nature around him. His early fascination with storytelling grew stronger as he attended art classes and sold small drawings to neighbors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At age 16, Walt dropped out of high school to join the Red Cross during World War I, where he worked as an ambulance driver in France. Upon returning, he pursued art full-time, moving to Kansas City to work at a commercial art studio.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Early Struggles</span>
                    <p>Walt faced significant challenges early in his career. His first animation company, Laugh-O-Gram Studios, went bankrupt in 1923. Despite this setback, he moved to Hollywood with little money but big dreams. There, he and his brother Roy started the Disney Brothers Studio, laying the foundation for his future success.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>The Spark of Genius</span>
                    <p>Even after losing rights to his first successful cartoon character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt refused to give up. This loss inspired him to create Mickey Mouse, debuting in Steamboat Willie, the first synchronized sound cartoon. The rest is history.</p>
